# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Onyedikachi Nzute

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for using code to solve real-world problems and build tools that make a difference. I'm currently focused on learning the foundations of software development and improving every day through hands-on coding and exploration.

ðŸ§  I enjoy breaking down complex problems and turning them into structured, working solutions â€” whether it's a simple script or a full application.

ðŸ’¡ I'm currently learning:
- Python, JavaScript, and Rust
- Git & GitHub
- Problem-solving with data structures and algorithms
- The basics of web development & software design

ðŸŽ¯ My goals:
- Build a strong portfolio of projects
- Learn by doing â€” through consistent practice and experimentation
- Contribute to open-source projects as I grow
- Make a positive impact through technology

ðŸ“« Let's connect!  
I'm always open to new learning opportunities, collaborations, and advice from other developers.
